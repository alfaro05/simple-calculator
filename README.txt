This is a simple project for learning purposes. It's currently working fine, but the user can only type integer values.
Underneath, there are two variables that receive the user input. The first number, that can have several digits, and the second number.
If the first number i 0, the user has to type it manually. This can be fixed. The user also has to type a new number after getting a result,
but it would be better if the result could be used as a value to calculate once again. This can also be fixed.
It should also support a "." button to insert decimal numbers. More functionalities can be added as well.
